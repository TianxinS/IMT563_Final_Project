2. Data dictionary provides basic information of each table's content.
3. Final project database ERD demonstrates entity relationships.
4. IMBD Data Access.ipynb contains the code that was used to access the movie data in IMDB.
5. Movie Recommendation.ipynb contains the code that was used to build the movie recommendations.
